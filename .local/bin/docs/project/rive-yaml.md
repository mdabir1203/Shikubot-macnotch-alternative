# Projects and `rive.yaml`

A project is a directory containing a `rive.yaml`. Everything else in it is
bundled by file extension:

| Extension | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `.luau` | scripts — protocol scripts and importable modules |
| `.wgsl` | shaders, compiled to RSTB |
| `.rml` | the scene, in as many files as you like, compiled as one document |
| `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.webp` | image assets |
| anything else | a blob asset, findable by name from scripts |

**The table is how sources are *discovered*, not a promise that everything in
the directory ends up in the `.riv`.** Assets are embedded when something
references them — a `file=` in the RML, or a `context:image` / blob lookup by
name from a script. A stray `notes.txt`, a font nothing uses, or the generator
script that wrote your scene adds nothing to the output, so `exclude` is for
keeping the *scan* tidy (and for keeping a second `.rml` from being picked up),
not for keeping weight out of the file.

Only `name` is required:

```yaml
name: myproject
```

`rive create <dir>` writes a `rive.yaml` with `name` taken from the directory
and log paths under `build/`, plus a `scene.rml` holding an empty artboard,
timeline and state machine, `AGENTS.md`, a `CLAUDE.md` that imports it, and a
`.gitignore` for `build/`.
Existing files are left alone.

## Starting from an editor file

```bash
rive create demo --from-rev=demo_file.rev    # or omit demo: the .rev's name is used
rive demo
```

`--from-rev` converts an editor `.rev` into a project: `scene.rml` with every
script, shader and asset written as a file and referenced with `file=`, then
the usual scaffold. Files land where the Assets panel had them — the folder
tree in the editor becomes the directory tree on disk:

    Assets panel                demo/
      main                        rive.yaml
      ui/                         scene.rml
        button                    main.luau
      images/                     ui/button.luau
        logo                      images/logo.png
      fonts/                      fonts/Inter.ttf
        Inter

Scripts keep working because a script's path *is* its module path: the editor's
`require('ui/button')` resolves to `ui/button.luau`. The directory must be empty
or new — the conversion writes a tree it cannot check file by file, so it never
merges into one.

The result is an ordinary project: `.luau` and `.wgsl` compile,
`png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`/`webp` are images, and fonts, svg, audio and other binaries
are blobs — still referenced correctly through `file=`, just not typed by the
scanner. Editor-only state (collaboration cursors, diff history) is dropped;
hosted fonts with no embedded bytes stay unresolved, as in any hand-written rml.

`--from-remote-file` runs the same conversion on a file in your Rive account
rather than a `.rev` on disk, and records it under `push:` so `rive push`
sends your edits back. With no value it lists your projects and files to pick
from; `--from-remote-file=<fileId>` goes straight to one. See
[push.md](../push.md).

## Keys

**`name`** — required. Also the name other projects use to import this one.

**`main`** — which artboard is the file's default, by name. Without it, the
first artboard declared wins in an RML project, and the first layout script
alphabetically in a script-only one. A name that matches no artboard fails the
build.

**`debugLevel`**, **`optimizationLevel`** — the editor's publish levels for
scripts, `none`, `medium` or `max`; defaults `none` and `max`.

**`shaderOutputs`** — the shader backends compiled on publish, a list from
`msl`, `glsl`, `wgsl`, `hlsl`, `spirv`; default all of them. These three and
`main` are what the editor keeps on the file's Backboard, which a fragment
never declares; `create --from-rev` writes them here from a rev.

**`artboard`** — default size and background for generated artboards. Applies
only when there is no `.rml`; RML artboards carry their own dimensions.
`background` must be quoted.

**`artboards`** — per-artboard overrides, keyed by name.

**`exclude`** — paths not to bundle at all.

**`excludeFromRev`** — drops matching things from the exported `.rev` only. The
`.riv` and the live window always contain everything. Four categories:

- `scripts` — by module path, Luau and WGSL
- `artboards` — by name
- `assets` — by name
- `contents` — asset *bytes*, keeping the asset referenced but unembedded

Patterns support `*` (any run of characters, including `/`) and `?` (one
character). Excluding a layout script also drops its generated artboard.

**`libraries`** — other project directories whose modules become importable
under their project name:

```luau
local button = require('lib:shared_widgets/button')
```

Dependencies resolve transitively, diamonds are shared, cycles are an error.
Each library also exports its own `.rev` alongside the project's.

**`revFlavor`** — `editable` (default) or `library`. Controls whether the
exported `.rev` opens as a normal editor file or as a library others import.

**`push`** — the Rive file `rive push` updates. Written back automatically by
the first push (`projectId` picks where the file is created, `fileId` binds
later pushes to it), and by `rive create --from-remote-file`, which binds the
project to the file it was made from; edit or remove it to retarget.

**`window`** — how the live window on macOS frames the scene. Every other
desktop keeps its ordinary frame and ignores the block; `--screenshot` and the
other headless runs never open a window and ignore it too.

- `titleBar` — `standard` (default) keeps the usual title bar strip above the
  scene. `integrated` draws the scene across the whole window, under the
  native close, minimize and zoom controls, with no strip of its own: the
  artboard is laid out to the full window height and the title text is
  hidden. The controls stay native, so their hover, accessibility and
  full-screen behaviour is the system's. Edits to the block apply to the
  running window on the next build, like any other edit.
- `controls` — where the native controls sit, `x` and `y` in points from the
  window's top-left corner. Only read with `titleBar: integrated`; leave the
  block out for the stock placement. A `y` deeper than the stock strip grows
  the strip, so a 52pt header centres its controls with `y: 19`.
- `dragHeight` — the strip along the top, in points, where a press on nothing
  interactive drags the window. A listener target, a text input or a scripted
  layout with pointer handlers keeps its presses. Left out, the strip is the
  height of the native controls; zero turns dragging off.

The scene learns where the chrome is through two numbers written into the
artboard's bound view model instance when it declares them: `titleBarHeight`
and `titleBarControlsWidth`, in points, both zero in full screen. Bind a
header's height and a spacer's width to them. The
[integrated_titlebar](../../samples/integrated_titlebar) sample is the
worked example: `rive "$(rive samples --path)/integrated_titlebar"`.

**`cursor.property`** — opt in to native cursors: the string or enum
property (a path on the artboard's bound view model, as `--data` spells one)
the scene writes cursor names into. The previewer shows what it names; without the key the OS cursor is never touched. See
[../cursor.md](../cursor.md).

**`output.dir`** — where the `.riv` is written. Defaults to `build`.

**`logs.file`** — append-only interleave of compiler problems, script `print`
output and system messages.

**`logs.problems`** — rewritten atomically per build with a generation header,
so it always reflects exactly one build. This is the file to read when
scripting around the tool.

## Layout on disk

Nothing is enforced beyond `rive.yaml` being at the root. A conventional
project:

```
myproject/
  rive.yaml
  scene.rml
  main.luau
  mathutil.luau
  mathutil_test.luau
  Montserrat.ttf
  logo.png
  build/
```

Asset paths in RML are project-relative:

```xml
<FontAsset file="Montserrat.ttf" name="Montserrat" id="0:30"/>
<ScriptAsset file="main.luau" name="main" id="0:80"/>
```

## Commands

```bash
rive create <dir>                 # scaffold yaml, scene.rml, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore
rive create <dir> --from-rev=f.rev  # the same, but scene.rml and its files come from an editor .rev
rive create <dir> --from-remote-file[=<fileId>]  # the same, from a file in your Rive account
rive <dir> --once                 # build once, exit non-zero on errors
rive <dir> --test                 # build, run every Tests script, exit non-zero on failures
rive <dir> --once --rev=out.rev   # also export an editor .rev
rive inspect <dir> --json         # dump the built scene and any ignored input
rive <dir> --artboard=<name>      # choose the artboard shown on launch
rive <dir> --optimize             # compile scripts at Luau O2 instead of O1
```

A directory literally named `create` or `login` must be passed as `./create`
or `./login`, so it is not read as the subcommand.
