# The RML format

RML is an XML projection of Rive's object model. There is no separate schema to
learn: **every element is a core type, every attribute is one of its properties,
and nesting stands in for the references those objects hold to each other.**

One `.rml` file describes a whole Rive file. `rive` compiles it to both outputs:
the runtime `.riv`, and the editor-openable `.rev`.

If you know the type you want, ask the tool rather than guessing:

```bash
rive schema Rectangle
```

## Read this first: build success is a weak signal

Misspelled names *are* caught -- `<Rect>` is a build error suggesting
`<Rectangle>`, and an unknown attribute names the property you probably meant.
You never have to wonder whether a name landed.

What survives a clean build is everything where the names are right and the
wiring is wrong: a bind pointing at a property that does not exist, a bind on
the wrong object, a type mismatch, a script input matching no field. Each
produces a file that loads, renders, and quietly does the wrong thing.

So two habits:

1. Look names up rather than inventing them: `rive schema --search`
   (`--json` on any `rive schema` form for a machine-readable answer).
2. Check what you built, not that the build succeeded:

```bash
rive inspect . --summary
rive inspect . --json
```

`problems` lists what is wired wrong; the summary counts what was really
produced by type, and `--json` shows the tree.

## Document structure

A document is a `<Rive>` root holding a flat sequence of root elements — a
forest under one wrapper, not a single tree:

```xml
<Rive version="1" kind="fragment">
    <Artboard defaultStateMachineId="0:7" width="500" height="500" name="Artboard" id="0:2">
        ...scene content...
    </Artboard>


    <ViewModel name="Settings" id="0:50">...</ViewModel>

    <ScriptAsset file="main.luau" name="main" id="0:80"/>
</Rive>
```

`<Rive>` carries two attributes, both required: `version="1"`, and
`kind="fragment"`, which every project file uses.

A project may hold any number of `.rml` files, in any folders. They compile as
one document: an id declared in one file can be referenced from another, an id
may not repeat across files, and a problem is reported against the file it is
in. Split by whatever reads well, artboards in one file and view models in
another, say. Files compile in path order, so that is the order artboards take
in the `.riv` and what "first artboard declared" means for `main`; name the
default artboard in `rive.yaml` rather than relying on a filename sorting
first.

Artboards hold scene content. Assets, view models, data converters and enums are
**root elements**, direct children of `<Rive>` and never nested inside an
artboard.

Do not write a `<Backboard>`. File-level settings — the default artboard and
the publish options — live in `rive.yaml`; see
[project/rive-yaml.md](project/rive-yaml.md).

An artboard's own `x` and `y` are its position on the editor's stage. Nothing
the CLI shows uses them, so a file with several artboards builds and runs
fine without any, but it opens in the editor with every artboard stacked at
the origin. Space them out when there is more than one, by their sizes plus
a gutter.

## Ids and references

An id is a numeric pair, `client:object` — `0:12`, `14:11981`. Anything else
is a compile error — leading zeros included (`04:23` is malformed, not an
alternate spelling of `4:23`) — and the `0:0` id is reserved.

A project created from an editor file (`create --from-rev`) already carries an
id on every element — those are the file's identities, preserved through build
and push; keep them.

It is valid for an element which isn't referenced anywhere in the file to not
have an id. It gets one at build and push, and `rive` writes that id back into
your `.rml` — so an element you left without one comes back with one, and keeps
it from then on.

That write-back is what holds identity across rebuilds and pushes: without it
the same element can be handed a different number the next time the numbering
shifts, and a push then reads it as a delete and an add rather than an edit.

Anything `excludeFromRev` drops gets no id written back.

They share **one namespace across the whole document**, not one per element
type. A `DataConverterGroupItem` and a `StateMachineLayer` cannot both be
`0:91`, even though nothing could ever confuse the two. Reusing one is a build
failure — `duplicate id "0:91"; every authored id must be unique` — so this
costs you a build rather than a debugging session, but it does mean a document
assembled from two examples that each start numbering at `0:10` will not
compile until you renumber one of them.

References are attributes holding another element's id, and they are always
named `<something>Id`: `styleId`, `scriptAssetId`, `fontAssetId`, `objectId`.
A reference to an id no element declares is a compile error (id lists and
the editor's dangling marker `0:0` excepted).

Most references you never write, because nesting sets them for you.

Nesting one element inside another sets a reference property on one of them. Which property, and which direction, is declared per property in the core defs.

### The child references its parent

Nest one of these inside an element of the referenced type and the property is filled in for you. The referent is found by walking **up** to the nearest matching ancestor, so it need not be the immediate parent.

| Element | Property set | Referenced type |
|---|---|---|
| `Animation` | `artboardId` | `Artboard` |
| `Asset` | `parentId` | `Asset` |
| `BlendAnimation` | `blendStateId` | `BlendState` |
| `CodeComponent` | `codeFileId` | `CodeFile` |
| `CodePoint` | `lineId` | `CodeLine` |
| `CodeRun` | `lineId` | `CodeLine` |
| `Component` | `parentId` | `ContainerComponent` |
| `DataBind` | `targetId` | `ViewModelInstance` |
| `DataConverterGroupItem` | `groupId` | `DataConverterGroup` |
| `DataEnumValue` | `enumId` | `DataEnum` |
| `FileAssetContents` | `assetId` | `FileAsset` |
| `FormulaToken` | `formulaId` | `DataConverterFormula` |
| `KeyFrame` | `keyedPropertyId` | `KeyedProperty` |
| `KeyboardInput`, `GamepadInput`, `SemanticInput` | `targetId` | the matching `ListenerInputType*` |
| `KeyedObject` | `animationId` | `Animation` |
| `KeyedProperty` | `keyedObjectId` | `KeyedObject` |
| `LayerState` | `layerId` | `StateMachineLayer` |
| `LibraryArtboard` | `assetId` | `LibraryAsset` |
| `LibraryEvent` | `artboardId` | `LibraryArtboard` |
| `ListenerAction` | `listenerId` | `StateMachineLayerComponent` or `StateMachineListener` |
| `ListenerInputType*` | `listenerId` | `StateMachineListener` |
| `ParentableDataItem` | `parentId` | `ParentableDataItem` |
| `ScriptInput*` | `scriptedObjectId` | the `Scripted*` object it feeds |
| `StateMachineComponent` | `folderId` | `StateMachineComponentFolder` |
| `StateMachineComponent` | `machineId` *(fallback)* | `StateMachine` |
| `StateMachineFireAction` | `layerComponentId` | `StateMachineLayerComponent` |
| `StateTransition` | `stateFromId` | `LayerState` |
| `TransitionCondition` | `transitionId` | `StateTransition` |
| `ViewModelInstance` | `viewModelId` | `ViewModel` |
| `ViewModelInstanceListItem` | `instanceListId` | `ViewModelInstanceList` |
| `ViewModelInstanceValue` | `viewModelInstanceId` | `ViewModelInstance` |
| `ViewModelProperty` | `viewModelId` | `ViewModel` |

### The parent references its child

These invert: nest the referenced type **inside** the element, and the element points at it.

| Element | Property set | Referenced type (as a child) |
|---|---|---|
| `BlendAnimationDirect` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |
| `BlendState1DViewModel` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |
| `DataConverterInterpolator` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |
| `DataConverterRangeMapper` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |
| `InterpolatingKeyFrame` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |
| `LayoutComponentStyle` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |
| `ListenerViewModelChange` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |
| `StateTransition` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |
| `TransitionPropertyViewModelComparator` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |
| `TransitionViewModelCondition` | `leftComparatorId` | `TransitionComparator` |
| `TransitionViewModelCondition` | `rightComparatorId` | `TransitionComparator` |

### Referenced but not parented

Declared as a reference with no parenting implication; these are resolved by other rules and may need an explicit id.

- `BindableProperty.dataBindId`

### Linked by nesting alone

A few types carry no reference in either direction — being a child *is* the
whole link, and there is no id to get wrong:

- **`LayoutParticipant`** inside the `Shape`, `Text` or `Image` it puts into the
  layout flow — see [layout.md](layout.md#shapes-and-text-inside-a-layout-box)
- **`ComponentOrigin`** inside the `LayoutComponent` whose pivot it sets
- **`TextStyleAxis`** inside its `TextStylePaint`
- **`Mesh`** inside the `Image` it deforms, and a `Skin` inside that `Mesh` or a
  `PointsPath` — see [rigging.md](rigging.md#skinning)

Contrast `LayoutComponentStyle`, which nests **and** needs `styleId`. The
difference is not guessable, so check which kind you are dealing with rather
than assuming.

Two consequences worth internalising:

**The referent is the nearest matching ancestor, not necessarily the parent.**
A `StateMachineComponent` inside a folder inside a state machine gets *both*
`folderId` (the folder) and `machineId` (the state machine, two levels up).

**Some references point down, not up.** A `KeyFrameInterpolator` nested inside a
`StateTransition` sets the *transition's* `interpolatorId`. The child is the
thing being pointed at.

## Listeners

A listener is a `StateMachineListenerSingle` declared inside the state machine.
It carries both what it watches (`targetId`) and what gesture it responds to
(`listenerTypeValue`), and its action nests inside it:

```xml
<StateMachine name="State Machine 1" id="0:7">
    <StateMachineListenerSingle targetId="0:14" listenerTypeValue="click" name="Listener 1">
        <ListenerViewModelChange>
            <BindablePropertyBoolean propertyValue="true">
                <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:40-0:46" propertyKey="634" direction="true"/>
            </BindablePropertyBoolean>
        </ListenerViewModelChange>
    </StateMachineListenerSingle>
    ...
</StateMachine>
```

`ListenerViewModelChange` writes a view model property; see
[data.md](data.md#writing-a-value-back-from-a-listener).
`listenerTypeValue` accepts `enter`, `exit`, `down`, `up`, `move`, `click` and
more — `rive schema StateMachineListenerSingle` lists them all.

Older files use `ListenerTriggerChange`, `ListenerBoolChange` and
`ListenerNumberChange` to set deprecated state machine inputs; see
[state-machines.md](state-machines.md#from-inputs-deprecated).

### Listeners: two spellings

`StateMachineListenerSingle` is a listener with **one trigger folded into the
element**: `listenerTypeValue` (click, enter, drag, …) sits on the listener
itself. `StateMachineListener` is the general form: the element carries only
`targetId`, and **each trigger is a nested `ListenerInputType*` child** with
its own `listenerTypeValue` — several children make a listener that reacts to
several things. Keyboard and gamepad listeners are always the general form,
because their input types are what the key/button filters nest under:

```xml
<!-- 0:2 must own a <FocusData/> child; see focus.md -->
<StateMachineListener targetId="0:2" name="Arrows">
    <ListenerInputTypeKeyboard listenerTypeValue="keyboard">
        <KeyboardInput keyType="right" keyPhase="1"/>
        <KeyboardInput keyType="left" keyPhase="1"/>
    </ListenerInputTypeKeyboard>
    <ScriptedListenerAction scriptAssetId="0:80"/>
</StateMachineListener>
```

`keyType` names a key: `right`, `escape`, `a`, `f1`, `kpEnter`, and so on. The
four arrows also answer to `arrowRight`, `arrowLeft`, `arrowUp`, `arrowDown`.
Leaving it off, or writing `any`, matches every key. `rive schema
KeyboardInput` lists the set.

**Choose the phases you want.** `keyPhase` is a bitmask over the three
phases of one keystroke, and you add the bits you want:

| Bits | Means |
|---|---|
| `1` | down, the initial press |
| `2` | repeat, each auto-repeat tick while the key is held |
| `4` | up, the release |

A navigation listener wants `1`, or `3` to keep moving while the key is held.
`7` is all three, so one press fires the listener on the way down *and* again
on the way up, moving the selection twice. `0`, the default, matches nothing
at all, which makes the listener dead.

Combining only ever means "fire this more than once per keystroke", because
most listener actions cannot tell which phase they ran for. `3` is the one
combination with an obvious use.

`modifiers` is the same idea over `1` shift, `2` ctrl, `4` alt, `8` meta, but
it is matched **exactly**, not as a subset. `0` means the key with no
modifiers at all, and a listener that leaves it at `0` will not fire while
shift is held — which is why Tab and Shift+Tab need two separate inputs.

The nesting is the whole link: no `listenerId` on the input type, no
`targetId` on the inputs. An input type with no inputs matches every key, so
a `KeyboardInput` left outside its input type would silently widen the
listener to everything; that misplacement is a build error rather than a
quiet one. Note `listenerTypeValue` lives on
`ListenerInputType*` for these, and on `StateMachineListenerSingle` for a
pointer listener; the two are different types, and mixing them is a build
error. If a construct is not in the tables above, check with
`rive schema <Type>` which shape it uses.

## Nested artboards

A `NestedArtboard` embeds another artboard by id. The source artboard must be a
component — marked `isComponent="true"` and listed by a `ComponentAsset` — or
the file is malformed. See
[making an artboard nestable](#making-an-artboard-nestable) below.

```xml
<Artboard width="600" height="400" name="Screen" id="0:1">
    <NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="120" y="200" name="Left">
        <NestedStateMachine animationId="0:35" name="SM">
            <NestedBool inputId="0:36" nestedValue="true" name="on"/>
        </NestedStateMachine>
    </NestedArtboard>
</Artboard>

<Artboard isComponent="true" defaultStateMachineId="0:35" width="80" height="40" name="Switch" id="0:30">
    ...
</Artboard>

<ComponentAsset artboardId="0:30" name="Switch"/>
```

To drive the child's state machine inputs from the parent, nest a
`NestedStateMachine` naming the child's machine, and inside it a `NestedBool`,
`NestedNumber` or `NestedTrigger` naming the input. The value goes on
`nestedValue`, not `value`.

`NestedArtboardLeaf` is the lighter variant. It adds `fit` and
`alignmentX`/`alignmentY`, which control how the child is scaled into the space
the parent gives it — relevant when the leaf sits in a layout that sizes it. For
a leaf positioned by plain `x`/`y` the default `fill` is effectively a no-op.

### Driving the child's timelines

A state machine is not the only thing a parent can reach into. Two more children
of a `NestedArtboard` drive one of the child's `LinearAnimation`s directly,
naming it with `animationId` the same way `NestedStateMachine` names a machine:

```xml
<!-- play it: speed, mix and a playback flag -->
<NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="300" y="100" name="Spinner">
    <NestedSimpleAnimation animationId="0:35" isPlaying="true" speed="2" name="Play"/>
</NestedArtboard>

<!-- or scrub it from data -->
<NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="100" y="100" name="Dial">
    <NestedRemapAnimation animationId="0:35" name="Scrub">
        <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:60-0:62" propertyKey="202"/>
    </NestedRemapAnimation>
</NestedArtboard>
```

`NestedRemapAnimation` is the more useful of the two. Its `time` is
**animatable and bindable**, which makes a component's whole timeline
addressable as a single number — bind a `0`–`1` view model property to it and a
gauge, a progress ring or a character pose scrubs from data, with no state
machine on either side.

**`time` is a fraction of the duration, not seconds**, whatever `rive schema`
says: the runtime multiplies it by the animation's length. `0.5` is halfway
through, and `30` is not thirty seconds, it is thirty times past the end.

`NestedSimpleAnimation` plays instead of scrubbing, and its `isPlaying`
**defaults to `false`** — nest one without it and the child simply holds its
first frame. `speed` scales playback, and `mix` (on both, defaulting to `1`) is
how strongly the animation applies, so several can blend.

Both are only valid as a direct child of a `NestedArtboard`. Put one anywhere
else and it is dropped during load, silently — it does not fail the file, and
`--verify` and `problems` see nothing wrong.

### Making an artboard nestable

An artboard cannot be nested until it has been promoted to a component. In the
editor that is three steps: build the artboard, mark it as a component, and it
appears in the assets panel — only then can it be dropped into another artboard.

RML is the same sequence written out, with one difference: **the editor creates
the assets-panel entry for you, and in markup you write it yourself.** That
entry is the `ComponentAsset`.

```xml
<!-- 1. the artboard, 2. marked as a component -->
<Artboard isComponent="true" width="80" height="40" name="Switch" id="0:30">
    ...
</Artboard>

<!-- 3. its entry in the assets panel -->
<ComponentAsset artboardId="0:30" name="Switch"/>

<!-- 4. now it can be nested -->
<Artboard width="600" height="400" name="Screen" id="0:1">
    <NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="120" y="200" name="Left"/>
</Artboard>
```

`ComponentAsset` is a root element carrying only `artboardId` and `name` — no
file, nothing nested. One per component artboard.

All four steps are required. Skipping the mark or the asset entry produces a
file the editor would never have created, so treat them as one action: an
artboard meant for reuse gets `isComponent="true"` **and** a `ComponentAsset`,
written together.

Both build clean. `rive inspect` warns: `nested-artboard-not-component` for a
`NestedArtboard` pointing at an unmarked artboard, and `component-without-asset`
for a component with no asset entry. Older editor files may nest unmarked
artboards; write all four steps in anything new.

## Values

**Colors** are ARGB hex, no `#`: `colorValue="FFFF5A3C"` is opaque orange.

**Booleans** are `"true"` / `"false"`.

**Enums** accept a symbolic name or the underlying integer —
`layoutWidthScaleType="fill"` and `="1"` are identical. Prefer names; the
integers are what the `.rev` decompiler emits. An unrecognised name *is* an
error, and lists the accepted values, which makes enums the one place a typo is
caught for you. `rive schema <Type>` lists the names per property.

**Rotation is radians**, not degrees. A full turn is `6.2831855`.

**Fractional indices** are a fraction written as a string: `childOrder="3/4"`.
The type exists so a row can be inserted between two others without renumbering
the rest — pick any fraction that sorts between the neighbours. It appears on
`Component.childOrder` and on the `order` of folders, tags, enum values and view
model list items.

The slash is not optional, and this is the trap: `childOrder="1"` is not the
integer 1, it is a **malformed** fractional index. It does not error — a literal
with no `/` parses to the type's `invalid` value, so the ordering you wrote is
ignored and nothing tells you. Write `"1/1"`.

**Animation timing is frames.** `LinearAnimation` has `fps` (default 60) and
`duration` in frames, so two seconds at 60fps is `duration="120"`. Transition
durations, confusingly, are milliseconds.

**Inline source** for scripts and shaders goes in a CDATA block:

```xml
<ScriptAsset name="inline_main" id="0:80">
<![CDATA[
return function(context: Context): Layout<Inline>
    ...
end
]]>
</ScriptAsset>
```

When both `file` and inline text are present, the file wins.

## Animation

Keyframes address their target by **property key**, a number, not a name:

```xml
<LinearAnimation loopValue="loop" duration="120" name="Spin" id="0:6">
    <KeyedObject objectId="0:14">
        <KeyedProperty propertyKey="15">
            <KeyFrameDouble value="0" interpolationType="linear"/>
            <KeyFrameDouble value="6.2831855" interpolationType="linear" frame="120"/>
        </KeyedProperty>
    </KeyedObject>
</LinearAnimation>
```

`propertyKey="15"` is rotation. Never guess these:

```bash
rive schema Shape --animatable
```

Note `KeyedObject.objectId` is one of the few references you write explicitly —
the animation lives beside the objects it animates, not inside them.

### The keyframe type must match the property

`KeyFrameDouble` is only for `double` properties. Every field type has its own
keyframe element, and the one you nest has to match what the `propertyKey`
points at:

| Property type | Keyframe |
|---|---|
| `double` | `KeyFrameDouble` |
| `Color` | `KeyFrameColor` |
| `bool` | `KeyFrameBool` |
| `uint` (including enums) | `KeyFrameUint` |
| `String` | `KeyFrameString` |
| `Id` | `KeyFrameId` |
| `callback` | `KeyFrameCallback` |

`rive schema <Type>` gives the type of any property, and `--animatable` lists
only the ones that can be keyed at all.

A `callback` property carries no value — `KeyFrameCallback` takes a `frame` and
nothing else, and firing it *does* something rather than setting something. See
[luau/protocols.md](luau/protocols.md#the-trigger-has-two-keys) for the one you
are most likely to key.

Two common non-double cases:

```xml
<!-- fade a fill from blue to red: SolidColor.colorValue is key 37 -->
<KeyedProperty propertyKey="37">
    <KeyFrameColor value="FF57A5E0" frame="0" interpolationType="linear"/>
    <KeyFrameColor value="FFE0573C" frame="60" interpolationType="linear"/>
</KeyedProperty>

<!-- switch which child of a Solo is showing: activeComponentId is key 296 -->
<KeyedProperty propertyKey="296">
    <KeyFrameId value="0:61" frame="0" interpolationType="hold"/>
    <KeyFrameId value="0:62" frame="30" interpolationType="hold"/>
</KeyedProperty>
```

Reference and boolean keyframes only make sense as `hold` — there is no halfway
between two ids. Colours interpolate channel by channel.

Mismatching them fails silently. A `KeyFrameDouble` on a colour property builds
without complaint, `rive inspect` reports nothing, and at runtime the value is
never written — the property just sits at its authored value while the timeline
plays. If a keyed property refuses to animate and everything looks right, check
the keyframe element before anything else.

## State machines

Every `StateMachineLayer` needs an `AnyState`, an `ExitState` and an
`EntryState`, even if unused. Without all three the layer does not import.

```xml
<StateMachine name="State Machine 1" id="0:7">
    <StateMachineLayer name="Layer 1" id="0:8">
        <AnyState/>
        <ExitState/>
        <EntryState>
            <StateTransition stateToId="0:12"/>
        </EntryState>
        <AnimationState animationId="0:6" id="0:12"/>
    </StateMachineLayer>
</StateMachine>
```

An artboard plays a state machine automatically when its `defaultStateMachineId`
names one.

This section covers the grammar only. Exit time, transition flags, view model
conditions, multiple layers and events are in
[state-machines.md](state-machines.md).

## Data binding

`DataBindContext` nests under the object it drives, naming the target property
by key and the source by path:

```xml
<TextValueRun styleId="0:21" text="placeholder" name="Run">
    <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:40-0:45" propertyKey="268"/>
</TextValueRun>
```

`sourcePathIds` is a dash-separated **absolute** path: it starts at a view model
id and walks property ids. `"0:40-0:45"` means view model `0:40`, its property
`0:45`. To reach through a nested view model, add a segment — the middle segment
must be a `ViewModelPropertyViewModel`, and the walk continues inside the view
model it references.

Relative paths are not supported. Bind the deepest concrete property directly.

A dangling path is not an error. A bind whose `sourcePathIds` names a property
that does not exist compiles, loads, and silently does nothing — so verify with
`rive inspect` rather than assuming.

Bind the property that actually exists on the target: `width` lives on
`Rectangle`, not on the enclosing `Shape`. Binding `propertyKey="20"` under the
`Shape` compiles and does nothing.

## Limits

Authoring these will fail or silently diverge from what the editor produces:

- **Bind paths are absolute.** The relative (`nameBased`) form the editor emits
  resolves through a `ManifestAsset` nothing here builds, so setting the flag by
  hand produces a bind that never resolves — see
  [gotchas.md](gotchas.md#bind-paths-you-author-here-are-absolute).
- **No library assets.** `LibraryAsset` is an error.
- **No treeshaking.** Everything authored is exported, except an image, PSD
  layer, font, audio or blob asset with `exportFlags="2"`, which is dropped.
- Keyframe interpolators are not deduplicated.
- Scripts and shaders always embed; `exportTypeValue` only applies to images
  (PSD layers included), fonts, audio and blobs. See
  [assets.md](assets.md#referenced-and-hosted-assets).
